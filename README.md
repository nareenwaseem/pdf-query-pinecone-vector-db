I developed a question-answering portal that processes uploaded PDFs to generate responses based on similarity scores. This project leverages Pinecone vector database for vector storage and retrieval, OpenAI embedding model for generating embeddings, and LangChain for managing vector data operations. By integrating these technologies, the system efficiently extracts vectors from the uploaded PDFs, matches them based on similarity, and provides accurate answers to user queries.
